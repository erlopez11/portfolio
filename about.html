                    <h2>Hello, I'm Elainy Lopez.</h2>
                    <p> I am an aspiring front end developer and artist based in Dallas, TX. I hold a BFA in art and a BA in anthropology from SOuthern Methodist Universiy, along with a Masters of art education from the Univeristy of Texas at Austin. I worked as an art teacher for almost 3 years before decising to emplore the world of front end development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the past, I always felt coding and web design was an area that was out of reach due to its technical and logic based characteristics. Having focused on fine arts it felt daunting to learn to code. But after an introduction to the true nature of front end development, I learned of interconnectedness between art and coding. This helped me to realize that through patience and practice I could teach myself about html, css, and javascript. I'm currently enjoying the process of learning front end development and challenging myself to learnt to code.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am an avid learner; I enjoy falling into the rabbit hole of learning and research about whichever topic is currently of interest to me. I am also an artist who works in watercolor, printmaking, ceramics, and drawing. When O am not learning front end development or making art, I can be found reading, watching movies, or spending quality time with all my pets. </p>
